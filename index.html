                <p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to my person website. I'm, Mason, a mission and service orientated policy professional. I feel strongly about helping others, 
                    whether that is through mentorship, supporting national security, or responsibly advancing technology and innovation. In this, I enjoy working collaboratively 
                    with my colleagues around the globe on difficult issues. I have had the good forunate to work across 8 government agencies - five as a fed, two as a contractor, and 
                    one as a scienist.                     
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In my day job, I am a tech policy executive at IBM when I engage in public policy work across AI, cybersecurity, quantum, cloud, 
                    and trade. With technical background, grounded in math and computer science degrees, I often act as a translator helping to communicate amongst business,
                    government, and research leaders. I also engage in policy work through various organizations including the <a href="https://thealliance.ai">AI Alliance</a>
                    and the <a href="https://www.csp-ab.com/">Cloud Service Providers Advisory Board</a>. For work matters, please reach out to me via email at: 
                    <a href="mailto:Mason@IBM.com">Mason@IBM.com</a></p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I previously workded at Guidehouse, where I supported two federal clients - the Department of Justice and the Department of State, 
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research. During my time at Guidehouse, I also helped lead the company's Cybersecurity Recruitment and Retention Team, the 
                    Cybersecurity Communications Team, and the Cybersecurity Community of Practice.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In my last government role, I served as the Special Assistant to the DoD Deputy Chief Information Officer for Cybersecurity / 
                    DoD Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and as the head of the Cybersecurity Policy, Strategy, International, Industry Engagement, and Scorecard Offices. 
                    In this role, I helped shape the strategic direction of the DoD’s cybersecurity; develop robust cybersecurity risk management methodologies, practices, and 
                    metrics; and lead DoD-wide strategic cybersecurity initiatives to burn down cyber risk enabling and protecting the warfighter. Leading the DoD CIO’s 
                    Cybersecurity Partnerships divisions, I worked to strengthened partnerships with international and industry allies and partners.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier in my career, I developed national-level strategy and policy at various government offices including as a member of 
                    Gen. Paul Nakasone's CAG, in the Office of the National Manager for National Security Systems, in the office of the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity 
                    at the Department of Homeland Security (now CISA), and in the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I hold a master’s degree in cybersecurity from The George Washington University (recipient of CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service) 
                    and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from Alma College. Outside of work, I coach soccer, mentor others, sometimes teach adjunct, and
                    enjoy the outdoors as an avid hiker and skier.</p>
